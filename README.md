# Simple_Computer_Vision

I created simple Pytorch models for the MNIST and CIFAR10 Dataset.

Achieves 97% accuracy on MNIST and 80% accuracy on CIFAR10.
This is not great, but this is just a simple exercise (like Hello World for computer vision).

To run, simply open the .ipynb (either with Google Colaboratory or Jupyter notebook) and run the cells.
The model weights and datasets themselves are not in the repo because they exceed Github file size. However, the .ipynb interactive notebooks will generate them!


Results:
